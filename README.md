Analytical Tool Features :

1. Runs on any Pytorch Model and provides the Graphical Analysis of Execution
2. Fast Hardware Performance Estimation (Runtime, Energy and Area), allows overlapped execution and prefetching
3. Rapid Automatic Hardware Design over a Set of Dataflow Graph, and the corresponding Scheduling Algorithm
4. Allow Specifying Different Optimization and Constraints
